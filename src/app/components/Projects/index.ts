This approach also benefits developers by reducing their liability; they do not need to develop their own authentication systems. Additionally, Cabal provides a web client dashboard where users can upload and manage important personal information, oversee which services have access to specific data pieces, and revoke access to their data as needed. Essentially, Cabal Auth aims to enhance onboarding experiences, decrease friction in user-service interactions, and ensure user data privacy and control.",
